# Robinhood: The Future Of Personal Finance


## Overview and Origin
FinTech startups have been disrupting various segments of the economy traditionally dominated by established brick and mortar behemoths.  Robinhood, the company with the mission statement, "We're on a mission to democratize finance for all", is disrupting the personal finance and investment management sectors by eliminating the human element and reducing or completely eliminating associated consumer fees.

Robinhood, a private company founded on April 18, 2013 by two friends, Vladamir Tenev and Baju Bhatt who wanted to expand access to the "financial markets, not just to the wealthy". Both educated at Stanford University, the two had gained experience from selling trading software technologies while in New York. Robinhood, the company built from their ingenuity would virtually eliminate the high costs associated with investing for the everyday user. The everyday users associated costs, would be on par with the Wall Street firms, who essentially pay zero, resulting in the likelihood there would be increased participation in the financial system. Robinhood has a aprroximately 52 investors and has raised over $2.2B in funding.

## Business Activities

Access to the financial system has been mostly afforded to the wealthy. Traditionally, the wealthy could afford to pay the $5-10 per trade fee, as well as satisfy the account minimums. Investing is already a risk with no guarantees. The everyday person may find the trade requirement fee substainial as well as the unease in satisfying the account minimum, which in turns commits them to investing, thus exposing them financially. Robinhood steps in with no account minimums, no trade fees, and its users originally could purchase as little as 1 share (now fractional shares are available). By reducing financial exposure and simplifying the process to purchase stocks, Robinhood hopes to encourage increased participation in the financial system right from their smartphones.

By the user utilizing their smartphone, via the Robinhood App, Robinhood has tremendous upside with the millenial age group, people with limitied access to the financial markets, the casual trader, and anyone else wanting to take control of their investment experience. Robinhood's technology stack consists of Bootstrap, Python, Rollbar, Amazon(EC2, Route 53), and DigiCert, etc. Robinhood's API is mainly built with a Python framework.

## Landscapes

Robinhood operates in the financial services sector offering its users access to invest in stocks, ETFs, and recently added Crypotcurrencies to invest in through its electronic platform. Within the financial services sector, the electronic platform is nothing new. The combination of zero commissions and the ability to invest from a smartphone on the other hand are. Within this sector we have seen an attmept to provide more access, although limited from Etrade first then other innovators such as Stash and Acorns that utilize the mobile app technology to allow users to invest with micro-amounts, but these technologies can charge a fee. Although there are fees or costs associated with some of Robinhoods competitors, they are modest in comparison to tradtional firms. Electronic platforms for investing is  becoming a crowded space.

Company | Fee | Commission | Account Minimum
--------|-----|------------| -----------
Robinhood | $0 |   $0        | $0
Stash* | $1-9/mth | $0 | $0
Acorns* |$1-5/mth| $0 | $0
ETrade*| $0| $0 |$0

*Accounts with these companies have fees and my have fees associated with management or various trades.

## Results
Robinhood has generated some controversy since its inception. This includes outages, security breaches, SEC probes, and failure to account for price increases that did not ensure its clients received the best price. However, Robinhood has increased participation in the  financial system. The company has over 13 million users with revenue exceeding $180M Q2 2020, and continues to receive funding. Robinhood currently has a valuation approaching $10B with $6.7B in assets under management. Overall the company is performing well, but should expect more competition in the future as it enters the cryptocurrency arena and tries to muscle more space fromm the traditonal establishment.

## Recommendations 

Robinhood in the future should look at the prospect of offering a feature that allows users to convert to an IRA or rollover an existing IRA. This could be an increased risk for the investor, but it would increase the assets under management for Robinhood, while offering the ability for investors to take more control of their investments. This could also require a partnership. The right partnership could be beneficial to Robinhood by assisting with furthering its objectives. An example, would be partnering with a bank or grocery chain to allow people looking to setup an account without a personal banking account to deposit money via their location directly into the Robinhood App. This could dramatically expand access to the financial system while increasing managed assets. The company should as well provide more literature about investing and financial management.
